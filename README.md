# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

The goal of this assignment was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It should also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

To accomplish this, primarily a combination of arrays (and their functions), for loops, and Math.random were used.

Some required functions/methods were researched outside of the lesson plan.  This includes isNaN(), .join(), .concat().  It only involved a simple look at syntax documentation.

The only real challenge I faced was when I misunderstood the assignment requirements and believed that the generated password needed to guarantee including at least one of each of the possible set of characters for which the user chose "true".

Future improvements include potentially shortening the code.  I imagine there must be a better/simpler/more concise way of writing the if/else statements.  Also, I do believe somehow incorporating the above idea of guaranteeing at least 1 character from each chosen set would be a fine addition.
